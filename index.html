                    <p>
                        I worked on creating a defense against adversarial attacks for image models using a VAE to reconstruct the perturbed image building on existing research which uses this approach.
                        Our VAE was able to create higher resolution reconstructions and achieve a slightly better performance across multiple attack methods.

                    <p>
                        The model was trained on CIFAR10 and evaluated against the FGSM, RAND-FGSM, and CW adversarial attacks.
                        After this research, I became more interested in exploring what techniques can allow models to become inherently more robust and experimented with different ideas.

                    <h5>Deep Doodle Renderer - 2018</h5>
                    <p>
                        For one of my first computer vision projects, I created a deep neural network model with the objective of making simple doodles more realistic.
                        I restricted the class of objects to just 3 types of fruits initially to simplify the task.

                    <img src="imgs/doodleproject.png" width="100%">
                    <p>
                        Using an ensemble of deep convolutional autoencoders with different depths and a GAN based on DeblurGAN, this model renders the doodle with color and shade and uses the GAN to sharpen the output and add more realistic effects.
                        The GAN slightly improved the output, but added some artifacts which I believe was partially a result of the GAN being too small.

                    <h5>Market Prediction Using Google Search Trends - 2018</h5>
                    <p>
                        Using data from Google trends of different kinds of search phrases like "stocks to buy" or "stocks to sell", I experimented with different deep learning based approaches to predict how the DOWJIA and S&P500 would react.
                        I experimented with different models and other financial data including options data, initially treating this as a sequential prediction task using an LSTM. Later, due to time limitations, I simply aimed to gauge the positivity or negativaty of different Google search phrases and predict whether the DOWJIA or S&P500 would go up or down in response the following week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Across different models, training approaches, and features, I achieved on average, a somewhat better than chance prediction of around 55%-60% accuracy in forcasting in a week how the market would move.
                        This project was inspired by existing research which did not use machine learning and evaluated performance differently, but it looked like I had similiar results to.
